# Pixel
This is a simple find and seek game. Players try to find a black pixel and click it to get points. Each click is worth 20 points. There is a 4 seconds time limit between clicks. If you don't meet the time limit, you have to restart--starting over with 0 points.

The pixel is actually surrounded by a slightly larger box that is clickable. This is to remove much of the frustration of not perfectly plasing the cursor on the one pixel, but maintaining a serious difficultly to the game.
